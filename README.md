# Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Challenge: Budget Tracker

## Description

For this challenge, I was tasked with updating a simple budget tracking application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to record expenses and deposits to their budget app with or without an internet connection. Offline transactions are updated to the app when the user returns back online.

The application’s front end has already been created. It's my job to add offline persistence with IndexedDB, implement PWA functionality, and then deploy the finished application to Heroku via MongoDB Atlas.

### User Story

AS AN avid traveler  
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection  
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling  

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection  
WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit  
THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit  
WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection  
THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated
